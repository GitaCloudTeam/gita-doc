# Auto ServiceAccount token mounted

Service Accounts are a Kubernetes native solution for controlling
authentication and when used in conjunction with Roles also enable
resource access control. It uses a signed JWT to authenticate with the
API Server, typically generated by the Admission controller.

Every Pod has a Service Account, using the namespace's default one when
not explicitly set. Once the Pod's container has access to the Service
Account token, it gains full access to the Kubernetes API, as it can
then authenticate with the API Server. However, the only use case where
a container may require access to the Kubernetes API is when it's
directly interacting with the cluster and its resources. For programs
not falling under such use case, access to the Service Account token
only increases the attack surface to the cluster.

For that reason, Service Account tokens are not made available to the
container by default, but can be configured to be automatically mounted
through the manifest option `automountServiceAccountToken`. In order to
explicitly disable this feature, set the option to `false` as follows:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: example-sa
automountServiceAccountToken: false
```

The same option can be set on Pod manifests, as can be seen on the
example below:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: redis
spec:
  containers:
    - name: redis
      image: redis:latest
  automountServiceAccountToken: false
```
