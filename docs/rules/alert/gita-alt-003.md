# Insufficient PID in Kubernetes Nodes

Kubernetes nodes rely on process IDs (PIDs) to manage and execute workloads. When a node runs out of available PIDs, it enters an Insufficient PID condition, preventing new processes from being created. This can disrupt workloads and compromise the stability of the cluster.

PID exhaustion is often caused by high process creation rates or unoptimized application configurations. Monitoring and optimizing process usage is crucial to avoiding this issue.

To prevent PID pressure, configure PID limits appropriately and ensure workloads use resources efficiently.
