# Disk Pressure in Kubernetes Nodes

Kubernetes nodes operate with finite disk space, which is essential for storing logs, temporary files, and other system data. When this space becomes critically low, the node enters a Disk Pressure condition, potentially affecting its performance and the stability of the entire cluster.

Disk pressure is typically caused by resource mismanagement, excessive logs, or unmonitored storage usage. Addressing it promptly ensures smoother operations and reduces risks of disruptions in the cluster.

To identify and resolve disk pressure, monitor the node's status and ensure sufficient disk space is available.
