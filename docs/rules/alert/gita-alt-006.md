Node Storage Usage Exceeds Threshold
Kubernetes nodes require sufficient storage availability to ensure smooth operation of system processes and workloads. When storage availability on a node falls below a defined percentage (default: 20%) of its total capacity, it can lead to degraded performance or system failures.

## Common Causes
Rapid growth in temporary or log files.
Inefficient storage allocation strategies.
Unmonitored disk usage over time.
