# Insufficient Memory in Kubernetes Nodes

Kubernetes nodes require adequate memory to ensure the smooth execution of workloads and system processes. When a node experiences Insufficient Memory, it may enter a critical state, leading to degraded performance or even workload eviction.

Memory pressure often arises from resource overcommitment, memory leaks, or unoptimized application usage. Monitoring and addressing these issues is vital for maintaining the stability and reliability of the cluster.

To mitigate insufficient memory, ensure proper resource allocation, and monitor memory usage consistently.
